## Art History Quiz

For my project, I decided to quiz the user on some art history questions. Primarily using javascipt, I have created a dynamic interactive opportunity for the user to click their answer choice and be informed whether or not they chose the right answer. If they choose the right answer, they are awarded 5 points; if they choose an incorrect answer, 5 seconds is deducted from the timer. At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to save their score and their initials. Using localStorage, the user is able to view their score even after they refresh the page. For the sake of brevity with an already extensive code, I pseudocoded the first question, and since i used the same logic for each one, I decided against adding those extra comments. 

The only issue I am having with this project comes from printing the stored user data to the page. I am able to get it properly in localStorage, but everything I have tried to do prints either [object object] or 'undefined.' I am certain that it is an issue that I will be able to solve with just a little more time, but this project has caused me enough headache. It prints properly to the console, and I am at least proud of that.

Note: I am aware that my code needs to be refactored and I could end with the same product with shorter lines of code. I struggled with this project and have a difficult time understanding web APIs--I was far more focused on understanding how this works then I was on using shorthand. 

## Technologies

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I primarily used Javascript in order to make this a dynamic experience for the user.
