## Art History Quiz

For my project, I decided to quiz the user on some art history questions. Primarily using javascipt, I have created a dynamic interactive opportunity for the user to click their answer choice and be informed whether or not they chose the right answer. If they choose the right answer, they are awarded 5 points; if they choose an incorrect answer, 5 seconds is deducted from the timer. At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to save their score and their initials. Using localStorage, the user is able to view their score even after they refresh the page. 

## Technologies

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I primarily used Javascript in order to make this a dynamic experience for the user.

--for ask BCS: i am unable to acquire the code inside of the textInputValue in my code, which is being used for a the userData object that is eventually saved to localStorage. when console logging from inside of the saveScore() function, it prints properly to the console but does not read the value of the input field, and says it's undefined. There, it won't even show up in localStorage. when I console log from inside the loadScore() function, it doesn't show the value of the input field at all in the console.
